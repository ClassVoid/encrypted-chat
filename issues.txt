Stream:
    -the stream has a 10-11 seconds delay
    -i must find a way to close the stream in a gentle manner
    -do i stream to a single chat? 
        is much easier to "just stream", whoever finds the stream key
        gets to watch
    -i could automatically send to current_chat the link to the stream 
    -you need settings where you get to set the link to the streaming server along with the key
